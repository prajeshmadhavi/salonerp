Is the requirement for the saloon app that we are going to develop. We will use next js front end and supabase backend. 

I will tell you the functionality in brief. Your role is to create database schema and functionality mapping document. With table and their fields. 

create functionality_mapping.md and schema.sql files. 

While creating functionality mapping document, make sure You put validations in markup document, map every field with corresponding table name and column name, Create relationship between tables Use id field for every table, which is primary key and auto increment use created at and updated at fields, which automatically updates the creation and updation time stamp. Intelligently created development plan. Like writing functions. Use authentication feature provided by Superbase. Implement a saas model. Use  user_id as a differentiator fields in every table. Use supabase storage, edge functions. 

The database name will be salon_erp, we have supabase account and api keys. 

User will sign up and log in using social network ids like Google account, facebook account, Apple Account, Microsoft Account, etc. use Auth0 as 3rd party authentication which is supported by supabase

Use next.js framework with shadcn ui components. make next.js app to connect to supabase directly using websockets. 

use supabase storage for storing images. use supabase edge functions for server side processing. use supabase realtime for real time data streaming. use supabase and next.js to the best of your ability. 

Functionality starts below:


use supabase calendly for scheduling appointments. use auth0 wrapper for authentication.
